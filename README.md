# Marching Tetrahedrons

Marching Tetrahedrons is a technique used in computer graphics to render 3D models. It involves constructing tetrahedrons from adjacent data points in a volumetric data set, and using these tetrahedrons to determine if a point is inside or outside a solid. The marching tetrahedrons algorithm is typically used to create a surface mesh that represents the surface of the solid. This technique has applications beyond computer graphics, particularly in the field of medical imaging. To improve upon previous research there are a few direction I am trying to explore, such as improving the speed of the algorithm, using neural networks to optimize the placement and configuration of tetrahedrons, and/or applying the technique to medical imaging data.
