A repo that intends to build on previous Marching Tetrahedrons research

# âš¡Install Software
1. download cmake

zsh/macos
```sh
brew install vtk
```

3. Download Qt5
```sh
brew install qt@5
ls /usr/local/Cellar/qt@5

set(Qt5_DIR "<qt5_build_dir>/lib/cmake/Qt5")
set(CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH "<vtk_build_dir>")
```
