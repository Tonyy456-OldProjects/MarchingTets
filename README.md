# MarchingTets

Marching Tetrahedrons is a technique used in computer graphics to render 3D models. It involves constructing tetrahedrons from adjacent data points in a volumetric data set, and using these tetrahedrons to determine if a point is inside or outside a solid. The marching tetrahedrons algorithm is typically used to create a surface mesh that represents the surface of the solid. This technique has applications beyond computer graphics, particularly in the field of medical imaging. To improve upon previous research there are a few direction I am trying to explore, such as improving the speed of the algorithm, using neural networks to optimize the placement and configuration of tetrahedrons, and/or applying the technique to medical imaging data.

## ‚ö°Install Software
to build and run the application, you will need the following
* CMake (version 3.11 or later)
* VTK (version 9.2.6 or later)
* Qt5 (version 5.15.8 or later)

## üåüRunning the Project
1. Update CMakeLists.txt
```cmake
set(Qt5_DIR "<qt5_build_dir>/lib/cmake/Qt5")
set(CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH "<vtk_build_dir>")
```

2. Use the makefile for shortcuts
```sh
make
make run
```

## üëâ CMakeCompile.sh
If you want to add functionality to what the make file executes you can edit this script. 'make' calls it.
