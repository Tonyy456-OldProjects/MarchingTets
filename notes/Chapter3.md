# Important Components
the visualization pipeline and the rendering engine

Visualization Pipeline
- The visualization pipeline is used to acquire or create data, process that data, and either write the results to a file or pass the results to the rendering engine for display

Rendering Engine
- The rendering engine is responsible for creating a visual representation of the data

# vtkObject
the root object. kinda like object in other languages.

# Resource Management
- must pair a new() with a delete(). every object is created using new()
